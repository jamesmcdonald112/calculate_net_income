# My First Project (JavaScript)

## Project Overview
This project is designed to introduce me to the fundamentals of JavaScript through a practical application. Although I had some experience with this language in college, it was a nice refresher. 
I built a simple program to automate an account management routine by calculating the net income for the first month of running a small corner shop.

## Project Goals
- Practice JavaScript coding.
- Automate account management tasks.
- Calculate the net income by considering earnings and expenses.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of JavaScript.
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- The sync-input package for handling user input (provided by [hyperskill]([url](https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/31844))).
  
### Installation
- Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from Node.js official website.
- Create a new directory for the project and navigate to it in your terminal.


## Project Structure
- index.js: The main file containing your JavaScript code.
  

## Running the Project
To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

Example Output
The program will display the prices of the products and the total earnings from each product and then calculate the net income after subtracting expenses entered by the user.

```bash
Prices:
Bubblegum: $2
Toffee: $0.2
Ice cream: $5
Milk chocolate: $4
Doughnut: $2.5
Pancake: $3.2

Earned Amount:
Bubblegum: $202
Toffee: $118
Ice cream: $2250
Milk chocolate: $1680
Doughnut: $1075
Pancake: $80

Income: $5405
Staff Expenses:4000
Other Expenses:500

Net income: $905
```


## Conclusion
This project is a good starting point for JavaScript beginners, providing practical experience in handling arrays, user input, and basic calculations.
